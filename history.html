								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>Hello, I am Alang Artha Iwana. I am a logical problem-solver, a graduate of Computer Science from Mataram University trained to tackle complex issues. On the other hand, the stage is my second home, where I learn to understand humanity through the art of acting.</br>
								My journey has been shaped by these two seemingly different worlds. Since middle school, I discovered a passion for acting, a world that taught me about empathy, expression, and courage.</br> 
								My experience leading the theater club in high school, portraying various characters from a father to a madman, trained me to adapt and communicate effectively in front of an audience. This confidence led me to bigger stages, including starring as the lead actor in a campus film project titled “PULANG.”</br>
								However, I am also challenged by the precise world of technology. During my university years, I not only delved into programming logic but also honed my organizational and leadership skills in the Association of Computer Science Students (HMIF). As a member of the Organizational Division, I learned to manage events, solve problems critically (critical thinking), and act as a reliable mediator, skills that turned out to be not too different from directing a performance.</br>
								It may seem contrasting, but for me, code and scripts share similarities in that both require a deep understanding of the audience, a well-structured framework, and solid team collaboration. My experiences in OSIS and HMIF built a foundation of responsibility and time management, while the theater stage gave me the ability to “read the room” and convey ideas in a convincing manner.</br>
								Although my academic focus prevented me from participating in formal internship programs, I believe that my life and organizational experiences have provided me with unique advantages. I learned resilience at an early age, raised by my mother's large family, who taught me to be independent and calm in the face of any challenge.</br>
								Currently, I am eager to merge both worlds. I am ready to channel my technical problem-solving abilities and communication skills into a career in the tech industry. I actively develop myself through various platforms and plan to attend a bootcamp to deepen my skills, with the goal of building a meaningful and financially independent career.</br>
								<blockquote><strong> I believe that every challenge is an opportunity to grow. And I am ready for the next role.</strong></blockquote>
